# Reverse-Correlation
Visual stimuli and analysis code to determine the linear, spatial receptive field of individual neurons. See Noise_RevCorr.m for the stimulus code. A mouse will view the set of images generated by Noise_RevCorr for about twenty minutes while we record single-units from our Plexon Ephys rig. The .plx files that output are then sent into RevCorrUnits.m . That will perform a simple reverse correlation mapping technique, along with a pseudo-inverse regularized reverse correlation from Smyth et al. 2003. The regularization smoothes the receptive field and converts an under-determined system of equations (for the original reverse correlation) into an over-determined system.
